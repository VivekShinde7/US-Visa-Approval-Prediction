# US Visa Approval Prediction

This project aims to predict the approval of US visa applications for workers using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of historical visa applications and produces a prediction of approval based on various features such as employer details, job title, wage levels, and more.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to classify visa applications as either "approved" or "denied" using machine learning algorithms. 

By analyzing features, the model can predict whether a visa application is likely to be approved or not.

## Installation

# AWS-CICD-Deployment-with-Github-Actions

## 1. Login to AWS console.

## 2. Create IAM user for deployment

	#with specific access

	1. EC2 access : It is virtual machine

	2. ECR: Elastic Container registry to save your docker image in aws


	#Description: About the deployment

	1. Build docker image of the source code

	2. Push your docker image to ECR

	3. Launch Your EC2 

	4. Pull Your image from ECR in EC2

	5. Lauch your docker image in EC2

	#Policy:

	1. AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess

	2. AmazonEC2FullAccess

	
## 3. Create ECR repo to store/save docker image
    - Save the URI: 315865595366.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/visarepo

	
## 4. Create EC2 machine (Ubuntu) 

## 5. Open EC2 and Install docker in EC2 Machine:
	
	
	#optinal

	sudo apt-get update -y

	sudo apt-get upgrade
	
	#required

	curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

	sudo sh get-docker.sh

	sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

	newgrp docker
	
# 6. Configure EC2 as self-hosted runner:
    setting>actions>runner>new self hosted runner> choose os> then run command one by one


# 7. Setup github secrets:

   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   - AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
   - ECR_REPO
